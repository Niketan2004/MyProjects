# Java Coding Journey

## Overview
Welcome to my Java coding journey repository! Here, I'll be documenting my epic quest to master Java programming and conquer coding challenges.

## Recent Achievements
I've recently completed two comprehensive Java courses, laying a solid foundation for my coding journey. Additionally, I've been actively working on improving my problem-solving skills:

- Completed two Java courses, expanding my knowledge base.
- Solving as many questions to improve my Problem Solving Skill

  
In addition, I've created two mini projects to apply my skills:

1. **Guess the Number Game:** A fun game where the player guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game offers different difficulty levels to challenge the player's guessing skills.
   
2. **Rock Paper Scissors Game:** An interactive game where the player competes against the computer by selecting Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The outcome is determined based on the classic rules of the game.

## Goals
My mission is simple: to become a Java Programmer, mastering the art of coding and building awesome projects.
- Enhance my Java skills
- Boost confidence in tackling coding challenges
- Build an impressive portfolio of projects
